// Aware about API calls but used static data at a moment due to lack of time

// Aware about styles and component folders but couldn't capture due to lack of time.

2. Static data considering from the API. So hardcoded data is considered while UI
3. Implementing the 2 screens with proper folder structure as required in a project
